# Unity2D-Flying_Bee
&lt;Top-down casual - WebGL>

Sixth game. WebGL build.

Move a bee with mouse. Click on a bee, drag and draw path.
At first game starts with the 1 bee hive and 3 flowers. Bee flies to random direction unless player direct bee with mouse. 
When the bee arrives on flower it disappears for a second and then show up with nectar. You can tell whether the bee has nectar or not by seeing the nectar dripping on the bee’s body. 
And when the player direct bee to the hive then 1 nectar is saved. Whenever nectar is saved a bee is generated(born), and when there’s 5 nectar saved then you can install one hive by clicking hive image on the left side bar then clicking on the map where you want to put it.
When bee hits each other then game over.
